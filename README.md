# Steps

Coding challenge completed by: Anthony Albertyn

## Challenge

Build a Steps component based on the horizontal Steps component from [Ant Design] (https://ant.design/components/steps/)

Your implimentation does not need all the capabilities of Ant Design Steps, so a simplified implementation will do.

Create the following components:

```
<Steps>
  <Step title="first step" />
  <Step title="second step" />
  <Step title="third step" />
</Steps>
```

Do not use a component library to build the Steps and Step component and the code you write needs to be your own. You may draw inspiration from blog posts or other content published online.

The steps progress bar may be hidden for smaller screens.

The Steps component should not fail if there are no children Steps or if there is only one child step.
